# colour-guesser

## Intro
A mini-game which the application displays a block containing a random color, and the user's task is to guess the RGB of the colour. The label will update as user makes educated guesses, and displays hints when the user is approaching the correct value. Every correct guess will earn the user one point, and user can update the color by clicking the 'update color' button.

## Programming
The application is programmed in react native and the main code body is contained in 'App.js'. The node modules are not included in the source code as they will take an unnecessary amount of time to upload. They have to be installed manually according to the app dependencies. The program mainly uses states and conditions in order to achieve the functionality. The visuals can be improved in the future.
